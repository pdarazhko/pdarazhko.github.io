                                    - Implemented a server-side of microservices-based application that replaces the current manual and telephone processes to connect the end-user to a Delivery Service and process delivery orders. (Java 8, Spring, JAX-RS, MySQL, Redis, MongoDB, Docker, Kanban, ActiveMQ, EclipseLink, JUnit, TestNG, Microservices, REST API)

                                    - Integrated complex business logic based on JBoss Drools (BRMS) that allows writing customized rules without adding new code for every new request/requirement from the client, thus reducing rules code base by more than 10x.
                                </p>
                                <p>   
                                    - Designed complex reports with many subreports in Jasper Reports that impersonate during the application process. 
                                </p>
                                <p>   
                                    - Covered the API with integration tests and embedded them in an existing CI infrastructure. It increased the quality of service, almost entirely removed the need QA-tester for manual testing, and shortened the development cycle.
